small web app that indexes recipes that could help you cooking on a budget

*Notes

There is a file for how the example recipes need to be structured located in the folder: source/recipes/_example_recipe.html/erb. \n

The only thing that needs to be edited is the Frontmatter thats the bit between the two sets of  ( '---' ) \n

Also one thing to consider with the images if they can be resized to a maximum of 400px X 400px \n

As this will help with the layout on the page and the Images need to be saved in source/images/FOO.jpg replace "FOO" with the name of the food
