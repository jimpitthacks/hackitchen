This is a small web app that indexes recipes that could help you cooking on a budget


---

##### Notes 

There is an example file for how the recipes need to be structured located in the folder: 'source/recipes/_example_recipe.html/erb.'

The only thing that needs to be edited is the Frontmatter thats the bit between the two sets of  ( '---' ). 

Also one thing to consider with the images they need be to a maximum of 400px X 400px. 

As this will help with the layout on the page and the Images need to be saved in 'source/images/FOO.jpg' replace "FOO" with the name of the food.
