This is a small web app that indexes recipes that could help you cooking on a budget.


---

##### Notes 

There is an example file for the structure of the recipes located in the folder: 'source/recipes/_example_recipe.html/erb.'

The only thing that needs to be edited is the `Frontmatter` thats the bit between the two sets of  ( '---' ). 

Something to consider with the images is they need be to a maximum of 400px X 400px; as this will help keep the layout on the page consistent.

The Images need to be saved in 'source/images/FOO.jpg' replace "FOO" with the name of the food.

If you found the recipe online, please provide a link to the original recipe.
