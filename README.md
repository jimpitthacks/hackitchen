# Hack-IT-chen
---
This is a small web app that indexes recipes that could help you cooking on a budget.

### Installation
---
Once you have cloned the Repo run the following command

``` bundle install ``` this will install all the needed gems from the `Gemfile`

### Running the app
---
Run the command middle man serve to create a test server that will run the code so you can see the changes

### Notes 
---
There is an example file for the structure of the recipes located in the folder: 'source/recipes/example-recipe.html.erb.'

The only thing that needs to be edited is the `Frontmatter` thats the bit between the two sets of  ( '---' ). 

Something to consider with the images is they need be to a maximum of 400px X 400px; as this will help keep the layout on the page consistent.

The Images need to be saved in 'source/images/FOO.jpg' replace "FOO" with the name of the food.

If you found the recipe online, please provide a link to the original recipe.

*Note
If you dont know how to code no problem you can submit a recipe to the from located [here](https://discourse.leighhack.org/c/hackitchen/13) 
and one of the Hackspace Team will enter it on the app.
